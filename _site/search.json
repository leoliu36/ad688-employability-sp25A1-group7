    "text": "0.2 Literature Review Summary\nThe rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has reshaped the job market across the US, with demand for AI-related skills increasing dramatically. According to a study by PWC, jobs that require AI specialist skills are growing 3.5 times faster than all other job markets, with skilled AI workers being paid up to 25% more in some sectors (PwC (2024)). However, this increase in compensation is not limited to workers specialized in AI. Non-AI roles that require complementary skills such as digital literacy, analytical thinking, and teamwork are also seeing a 5–10% wage increase (Mäkelä and Stephany (2024)). According to US job vacancy data from 2018–2024, AI-related jobs are significantly more likely to include non-monetary benefits as part of the compensation package, including parental leave and remote working options (Stephany, Mira, and Bone (2025)).\nBeyond the benefit of not having to commute and the ability to work from anywhere, long-distance and remote roles are often sought after by job seekers due to faster wage growth. In a study comparing the pay trends of remote versus in-office workers in the same occupation, remote workers experienced 4.4% faster annual wage growth, especially in professional and technical sectors (Pabilonia and Vernon (2025)). Furthermore, workers who transitioned into remote roles with the same employer saw up to 16 percentage points higher wage growth than their counterparts who remained local (Romem (2024)). This demonstrates that switching into remote work can lead to significantly higher wage growth, even within the same company and/or job category."

    "text": "1.1 Remove Unnecessary Columns\nFirstly, columns containing redundant and irrelevant information were excluded from the dataset. Since the scope of this analysis is focused on job market trends in 2024, it is best practice to remove any outdated NAICS/SOC fields to prevent confusion and duplication. Similarly, metadata fields or duplicate fields that could introduce ambiguity and do not add any meaningful to downstream analysis are excluded. To summarize, unnecessary columns containing the following information were dropped:\n\nMeta/tracking\nDuplicated location info\nRaw/duplicate title & body\nDuplicated employment info\nEducation code columns\nRedundant NAICS/SOC versions\nLOT/V6 occupation hierarchy\nONET & CIP codes\nSectors"

    "section": "1.2 Handling of missing values",
    "text": "1.2 Handling of missing values\nWe addressed missing values based on field type and the amount of data missing per field:\n\n1.2.1 Numerical Fields\nMissing values in key numerical fields were imputed with the median of each respective fields. Since these numerical fields are key for grouping and visualizing trends, simply removing empty rows could reduce the diversity of the dataset and introduce biases. The rationale for imputing the median rather than the mean is that the latter tends to be influenced by outliers and skewed distributions, which is often exhibited in fields like “SALARY. Based on the downstream EDA, additional filtering may be applied to exclude imputed values altogether to prevent distorition and ensure statistical integrity in the trends observed.\n\n\n1.2.2 Categorical Fields\nMissing values in key categorical fields were imputed with the placeholder value “Unknown” in order to prevent those rows of data being dropped, leading to unnecessary data loss. By imputing a neutral label like “Unknown”, this strategy ensures that data integrity is retained without introducing false assumptions and biases into the downstream analysis.\n\n\n1.2.3 Columns containing Majority Missing Data\nWhile the above addressed the rationale for imputing missing values, having to impute the majority of a column’s values can also create noise, which provides insignificant information and analytical value to the downstream analysis. Therefore, columns containing more than 50% missing values were excluded from the dataset.\n\n\n\nNon-null Data"
