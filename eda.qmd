# Overview
This section explores job market trends and the restructuring of compensation through a series of visualizations. Each plot is chosen to reveal specific patterns in compensation, regional disparities, and the impact of AI and remote work.

## Salary by Remote Work Type

**Why this visualization was chosen:** 
To visually compare not just the average pay, but also the range and consistency of salaries across different work arrangements. This visualization could reveal that remote roles have a wider salary range, indicating that companies are paying a premium for top talent regardless of location.

**Key Insights:**
The median salaries across all work arrangements are similar, clustering around $115,000. However, both Remote and Hybrid Remote roles exhibit a much wider salary range and more high-paying outlier positions, with some remote roles exceeding $350,000. This suggests that while typical pay is comparable, remote-friendly positions offer significantly greater potential for top-end compensation.

## Top Skills vs. Average Salary

**Why this visualization was chosen:**
To identify which specific skills are most financially valuable in the current job market, connecting AI-related skills to compensation. This could reveal that skills related to AI/ML platforms command a significantly higher salary, even if they aren't the most frequently requested skills overall.

Among the 10 most in-demand skills, Data Analysis commands the highest average salary at over $120,000. While compensation for most top skills is competitive, technical skills like Data Analysis and Business Process show a slight financial advantage over the lowest-paid skill in this group, Management, which averages approximately $110,000.
