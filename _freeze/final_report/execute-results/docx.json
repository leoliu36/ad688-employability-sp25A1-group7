This analysis will examine the following key topics to uncover the factors that influence salary trends:\n\n**The restructuring of compensation due to AI, inflation, and remote work.**\n\nThe traditional pay structure is being reshaped as companies adapt to automation, rising costs of living, and a distributed workforce. These forces are pushing employers to rethink how they reward skills, experience, and location.\n\n**Growing pay disparities across regions, industries, and job types in 2024.**\n  \nHigh-paying jobs are increasingly concentrated in specific tech-driven sectors and urban hubs. Meanwhile, many essential or service-based roles are seeing slower wage growth, deepening inequality across the workforce.\n\n**Shifting salary patterns based on remote flexibility, job type, and sector growth.**\n  \nRemote roles now often offer comparable or even higher compensation due to talent shortages and broader applicant pools. Industries like tech and healthcare are setting new standards, while others struggle to keep pace.\n\n## Literature Review Summary\n\nThe rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has reshaped the job market across the US, with demand for AI-related skills increasing dramatically. According to a study by PWC, jobs that require AI specialist skills are growing 3.5 times faster than all other job markets, with skilled AI workers being paid up to 25% more in some sectors [@pwc2024]. However, this increase in compensation is not limited to workers specialized in AI. Non-AI roles that require complementary skills such as digital literacy, analytical thinking, and teamwork are also seeing a 5–10% wage increase [@makela2024]. According to US job vacancy data from 2018–2024, AI-related jobs are significantly more likely to include non-monetary benefits as part of the compensation package, including parental leave and remote working options [@stephany2025].\n\nBeyond the benefit of not having to commute and the ability to work from anywhere, long-distance and remote roles are often sought after by job seekers due to faster wage growth. In a study comparing the pay trends of remote versus in-office workers in the same occupation, remote workers experienced 4.4% faster annual wage growth, especially in professional and technical sectors [@pabilonia2025]. Furthermore, workers who transitioned into remote roles with the same employer saw up to 16 percentage points higher wage growth than their counterparts who remained local [@romem2024]. This demonstrates that switching into remote work can lead to significantly higher wage growth, even within the same company and/or job category.\n\n\n\n# Methodology\nBelow are the steps we took to prepare the dataset to ensure accuracy and statistical integrity in our exploratory data analysis (EDA). \n\n## Remove Unnecessary Columns\nFirstly, columns containing redundant and irrelevant information were excluded from the dataset. Since the scope of this analysis is focused on job market trends in 2024, it is best practice to remove any outdated NAICS/SOC fields to prevent confusion and duplication. Similarly, metadata fields or duplicate fields that could introduce ambiguity and do not add any meaningful to downstream analysis are excluded. To summarize, unnecessary columns containing the following information were dropped:\n\n- Meta/tracking\n- Duplicated location info\n- Raw/duplicate title & body\n- Duplicated employment info\n- Education code columns\n- Redundant NAICS/SOC versions\n- LOT/V6 occupation hierarchy\n- ONET & CIP codes \n- Sectors\n\n## Handling of missing values \nWe addressed missing values based on field type and the amount of data missing per field: \n\n### Numerical Fields\nMissing values in key numerical fields were imputed with the median of each respective fields. Since these numerical fields are key for grouping and visualizing trends, simply removing empty rows could reduce the diversity of the dataset and introduce biases. The rationale for imputing the median rather than the mean is that the latter tends to be influenced by outliers and skewed distributions, which is often exhibited in fields like \"SALARY. Based on the downstream EDA, additional filtering may be applied to exclude imputed values altogether to prevent distorition and ensure statistical integrity in the trends observed. \n\n### Categorical Fields\nMissing values in key categorical fields were imputed with the placeholder value \"Unknown\" in order to prevent those rows of data being dropped, leading to unnecessary data loss. By imputing a neutral label like \"Unknown\", this strategy ensures that data integrity is retained without introducing false assumptions and biases into the downstream analysis. \n\n### Columns containing Majority Missing Data\nWhile the above addressed the rationale for imputing missing values, having to impute the majority of a column's values can also create noise, which provides insignificant information and analytical value to the downstream analysis. Therefore, columns containing more than 50% missing values were excluded from the dataset. \n\n![Non-null Data](figures/non-null_data.png)\n\n## Remove Duplicates \nTo eliminate true duplicates from the dataset, job listings that have identical values in all the fields listed below were removed to prevent distortion and ensure statistical integrity: \n\n  - Job Title\n  - Company Name\n  - Location\n  - Posting Date\n  - Skill requirements\n  - Employment type\n\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=3}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n                         Column  Missing %\n           MAX_YEARS_EXPERIENCE  88.372093\n             MAX_EDULEVELS_NAME  77.495931\n                         SALARY  57.505035\n                      SALARY_TO  55.311871\n            ORIGINAL_PAY_PERIOD  55.311871\n                    SALARY_FROM  55.311871\n                       DURATION  37.678281\n           MIN_YEARS_EXPERIENCE  31.926398\n               MODELED_DURATION  26.607631\n                MODELED_EXPIRED  21.264035\n                        EXPIRED  10.819609\n                       MSA_NAME   5.447047\n                    COMPANY_RAW   0.746227\n                    TITLE_CLEAN   0.193109\n                     SOC_5_NAME   0.060691\n             SPECIALIZED_SKILLS   0.060691\n        SPECIALIZED_SKILLS_NAME   0.060691\n                 CERTIFICATIONS   0.060691\nLOT_SPECIALIZED_OCCUPATION_NAME   0.060691\n            CERTIFICATIONS_NAME   0.060691\n     LOT_SPECIALIZED_OCCUPATION   0.060691\n             COMMON_SKILLS_NAME   0.060691\n                    SKILLS_NAME   0.060691\n                SOFTWARE_SKILLS   0.060691\n           SOFTWARE_SKILLS_NAME   0.060691\n                  COMMON_SKILLS   0.060691\n              NAICS_2022_6_NAME   0.060691\n                         SKILLS   0.060691\n                          TITLE   0.060691\n                     STATE_NAME   0.060691\n                      CITY_NAME   0.060691\n               REMOTE_TYPE_NAME   0.060691\n                    REMOTE_TYPE   0.060691\n                  IS_INTERNSHIP   0.060691\n             MIN_EDULEVELS_NAME   0.060691\n            COMPANY_IS_STAFFING   0.060691\n                   COMPANY_NAME   0.060691\n                        COMPANY   0.060691\n                           BODY   0.060691\n                         POSTED   0.030346\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](final_report_files/figure-docx/cell-4-output-2.png){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Internal Skills Assessment\nTo evaluate the current technical skill set for each team member, each team member performed a self-rating for a set of core competencies for data analytics and data science, which included Python, SQL, Power BI, Tableau, Excel, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Cloud Computing, and AWS. The assessment was made on a five-point scale, and the rating values were then compiled into a dataframe for further analysis. We then leveraged a Seaborn heatmap to identify where our strengths concentrated and pinpoint where the gaps existed. \n\n::: {.cell execution_count=7}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](final_report_files/figure-docx/cell-8-output-1.png){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n![Team Skill Levels Heatmap](figures/Team_Skills_Heatmap.png)\n\n## External Skills Assessment using Natural Language Processing techniques\nTo identify the most in-demand skills in the analytics job market, we analyzed the job descriptions from the Lightcast dataset by leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to process the BODY column which contained detailed job descriptions. Below is a summary of the data preparation and extraction process:\n\t•\tText normalization: To ensure consistency, job descriptions were converted to lowercase, Unicode-normalized format, and whitespaces were stripped. \n\t•\tTokenization: Numbers and punctuation were filtered out to ensure words can be captured and extracted properly.\n\t•\tStopword removal: To further filter and concentrate only on meaningful technical words, common English stopwords were removed using Scikit-learn's built-in stopword list. \n\t•\tKeyword filtering: A predefined list of relevant analytics skills (e.g., Python, SQL, AWS, Tableau, Excel, Pandas, Spark, Machine Learning, NLP, Cloud Computing) was used to identify and count occurrences within the job descriptions.\n\t•\tFrequency analysis: Using Python's Counter() function, we tallied the frequency of each skill keyword and visualized in a column chart to understand their significance in the job market. \n\n::: {.cell execution_count=8}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nScanning job descriptions and counting tokens (streaming)...\nTop data analytics skills from job descriptions\ncloud:42787\nsql:35871\npower:21894\nexcel:19874\nlearning:16361\ntableau:14609\npython:13402\naws:8510\nmachine:5592\ncomputing:2588\nspark:1496\ndocker:613\npandas:378\nnlp:293\nnumpy:187\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](final_report_files/figure-docx/cell-9-output-2.png){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n![Most In-demand skills from Job Descriptions](figures/jd_top_skills.png)\n\n## Propose an Improvement Plan\nAccording to our analysis, job postings show high demand for Cloud, SQL, Python, ML, and AWS. Our team is strong in visualization (Excel, Power BI, Tableau) but weaker in Cloud, ML, and NLP. This plan aligns our learning with market needs, provides specific resources, and ensures collaboration strategies so the whole team can close the gap together.\n\n**Which skills should each member prioritize learning?**\n\n- **Angelina** – Strong in visualization tools (Power BI 5, Tableau 4, Excel 5). Next priorities: Cloud, AWS, Machine Learning, and NLP. These are high-demand in job postings (Cloud: 64k+, AWS: 10k+, ML/NLP combined: 23k+).  \n- **Devin** – Solid in Excel (5) and Tableau (3), but weakest in Python, ML, NLP, and AWS. Needs to raise Cloud as well.  \n- **Leo** – Stronger in Power BI (4) and Excel (4), but very low in ML, NLP, Cloud, and AWS. Should also build up Python and SQL to meet market demand (Python: 17k+, SQL: 43k+ mentions).  \n\n\n**What courses or resources can help?**\n\n- Cloud & AWS – free cloud provider tutorials, AWS Educate, and cloud labs for hands-on practice.  \n- Machine Learning & NLP – scikit-learn tutorials, Kaggle competitions, and university modules on ML/NLP.  \n- Python & SQL – interactive platforms (Jupyter notebooks, LeetCode SQL), and official documentation.  \n- Docker & Spark – short online workshops, Spark quickstarts, and Docker “getting started” labs.  \n\n\n**How can the team collaborate to bridge skill gaps?**\n\n- **Role rotation:** assign rotating leads (“cloud lead,” “ML/NLP lead,” “Python/SQL lead”) for mini-projects so each teammate practices outside their strengths.  \n- **Lightning talks:** weekly 15-minute sessions where one teammate teaches a concept or tool they just learned.  \n- **Pair programming:** match stronger members (for example, Angelina for visualization) with weaker ones (for example, Devin on Python) to share knowledge in real time.  \n- Shared resources: maintain a team wiki with reusable queries, cloud setup notes, and code snippets.  \n\n\n\n\n\n# Regression, Classification, and Topic Insights\n\n## KMeans Clustering Analysis\nWe performed KMeans clustering on job postings using core features (salary, minimum and maximum years of experience). This analysis seeks to segment jobs into groups with similar compensation and experience profiles, and to interpret these clusters using industry categories (NAICS).\n\n### Fit KMeans and Assign Clusters - Data Prep\nWe use KMeans clustering to segment jobs into five groups, using standardized salary and experience as inputs. Each posting is assigned to a cluster.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=13}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nKMeans labels column ready: True\nUnique clusters:

/ lower salary\n- Mid-career / moderate salary\n- Senior specialist / high salary\n\nThis segmentation aligns with career ladders and confirms the broad, positive relationship between experience and compensation.\n\n**Business relevance**\n\n- **Job seekers**: Use cluster patterns to target industries/roles occupying higher-pay segments and to plan upskilling.\n- **Employers**: Map openings to cluster ranges to calibrate pay bands against the external market and reduce attrition risk.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=17}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display

the model captures complex interactions more effectively.\n\nThe goal of this model is to predict job posting salary using experience and employment type features. The model uses an 80/20 train–test split and evaluates performance using RMSE and R² metrics.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=19}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nRoot Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 34744.38\nR² Score: 0.336\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Regression Results and Interpretation\nWe modeled salary using Minimum Years of Experience (MIN_YEARS_EXPERIENCE) and Remote Type (REMOTE_TYPE_NAME). We excluded MAX_YEARS_EXPERIENCE (>85% missing) to protect statistical integrity; this reduced sample size but improved reliability.\n\n**Model performance**\n\n**RMSE**: 34,744.38\n**R²**: 0.336\n\n**What this means**\nAn R² of 0.336 indicates experience and remote status explain a meaningful, but incomplete share of salary variation. That’s consistent with cross-industry labor data, where compensation is also driven by occupation, industry, location, and scarce technical capabilities.\n\n**Business relevance**\n- **For job seekers**: Experience contributes to higher earnings, but targeted specialization (e.g., analytics, cloud, data engineering) and industry selection are decisive for larger pay jumps.\n- **For employers**: Pricing talent solely by tenure can misalign offers in high-skill roles. Clear remote/on-site definitions in postings improve candidate signal and reduce noise in market benchmarking.\n\n**Outliers to review**\nA small number of postings show very high pay at low experience with unspecified remote type. These likely reflect specialized roles or incomplete records. In practice, validate or isolate these cases before setting salary bands or training production models.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=20}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](final_report_files/figure-docx/cell-21-output-1.png){}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n```\n<Figure size 600x480 with 0 Axes>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n![Predicted vs. Actual Salary (Random Forest Regression)](figures/Predicted_vs_Actual_RF_Regression.png)\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=21}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nTop 5 features influencing salary prediction:\nMIN_YEARS_EXPERIENCE: 0.953\nREMOTE_TYPE_NAME_Not Remote: 0.017\nREMOTE_TYPE_NAME_[None]: 0.015\nREMOTE_TYPE_NAME_Remote: 0.014\nREMOTE_TYPE_NAME_Unknown: 0.000\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=22}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](final_report_files/figure-docx/cell-23-output-1.png){}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n```\n<Figure size 600x480 with 0 Axes>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n![Top 5 Feature Importances (Random Forest Regression)](figures/Top_5_Feature_Importances_RF_Regression.png)\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=23}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n         SALARY  MIN_YEARS_EXPERIENCE REMOTE_TYPE_NAME\n10189  312500.0                   1.0           [None]\n19209  312000.0                   1.0           [None]\n31552  328600.0                   5.0           [None]\n2258   305000.0                   3.0           [None]\n29554  338750.0                   7.0           [None]\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=24}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](final_report_files/figure-docx/cell-25-output-1.png){}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n```\n<Figure size 600x480 with 0 Axes>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n![Top 5 Outlier Job Salaries](figures/Top_5_Outlier_Job_Salaries.png)\n\n## Outlier Jobs and Market Signals\nThe largest residuals include postings above $300,000 with only 1–5 years minimum experience, often missing a remote/on-site label. These cases point to specialized, high-impact roles where compensation is decoupled from tenure (e.g., advanced analytics, cloud/platform, niche leadership).\n\n**Business relevance**\n\n**Employers**: Standardize and QA high-pay, low-tenure postings, unclear fields and atypical mixes should be reviewed before publication.\n**Job seekers**: Outliers highlight skill paths where focused upskilling can command premium pay earlier in a career.\n\n## Classification – Predicting Remote vs On-Site Job\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=25}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nAccuracy: 0.619, F1 Score: 0.328\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](final_report_files/figure-docx/cell-26-output-2.png){}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n```\n<Figure size 600x480 with 0 Axes>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n![Confusion Matrix — Remote vs On-Site Classification](figures/Confusion_Matrix_Remote_vs_On-Site.png)\n\n### Classification Results and Interpretation\nWe trained a logistic regression to predict Remote vs On-Site using MIN_YEARS_EXPERIENCE plus an available categorical descriptor (e.g., employment type or state).\n\n**Performance**\n\n**Accuracy**: 0.622\n**F1 Score**: 0.327\n\n**What this means**\nThe model distinguishes remote vs. on-site at a moderate level, consistent with the idea that remote status is policy/role-design driven, not primarily a function of required experience.\n\n**Business relevance**\nEmployers: Remote flexibility can be offered across experience levels without materially distorting supply. If remote status is strategic, emphasize role/industry signals rather than tenure in postings.\nJob seekers: Remote options exist from entry to senior levels, broadening geographic reach and negotiation leverage.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n",
